## LLM-Keyword-augumentation-tool
LLM Keyword augumentation tool
## Overview
This is a web-based interactive tool designed for a digital forensics user study. It provides a file search interface where users can find relevant files from a dataset using keywords. The core feature is the ability to augment user-provided keywords with semantically related terms generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT.

## Key Features (주요 기능)
**Keyword-Based Search**: Performs a simple but effective substring search on filenames from a loaded CSV dataset.

**LLM Keyword Augmentation**: Takes user's base keywords and uses the OpenAI API to generate a list of semantically, thematically, and contextually related keywords.

**Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, it allows users to dynamically select/deselect LLM-generated keywords, view search results, and manage a list of selected "evidence" files.

**Time-Limited Sessions**: A built-in JavaScript timer limits each user session, simulating a time-sensitive investigation scenario.

**Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all significant user interactions (e.g., searches, keyword generation, evidence marking) into CSV files for later analysis.

**Pagination**: Search results are paginated for better readability and performance.

**State Management**: Uses Streamlit's session state to maintain user progress, selected files, and search results across interactions.

## Core concepts
**Search results**: Number of search results (single OR-combined search).

**Evidence selections**: Number of documents selected as evidence (cumulative selections).

## Install Dependencies (의존성 설치)
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

streamlit, pandas, openai, python-dotenv

**Then, install the packages using pip:**
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Prepare the Dataset (데이터셋 준비)
Create a dataset.csv file in the root directory. The file must contain at least a filename column. An optional label column can be included.

Example dataset.csv:

````
filename,label
report_final_v3.docx,T
meeting_notes_2023-10-25.txt,F
budget_projection_Q4.xlsx,T
personal_holiday_photos.zip,F
...
````

## Configure Environment Variables (환경 변수 설정)
You need an OpenAI API key to use the LLM feature. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your key.
````
.env:

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretOpenAiApiKeyHere"
````

## ▶️ How to Run (실행 방법)
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with the following command:
````
streamlit run app.py
````

## 📖 How to Use (사용 방법)
1. Enter Your Name: Start by entering your name or participant ID in the sidebar.

2. Read the Scenario: The main page displays the investigation scenario.

3. Input Keywords: Enter initial keywords related to the scenario in the text input box.

4. Generate Augmented Keywords: Click the "Generate Augmented Keywords" button. The app will call the OpenAI API and display a list of suggested keywords.

5. Select Keywords: Choose the most relevant keywords from the generated list. Your initial keywords and the selected augmented keywords will be combined for the search.

6. Search: Click the "Search" button to see the results.

7. Select Evidence: Review the search results. Use the checkboxes or click on the filenames to select files as evidence.

8. Save Evidence: Click the "selected items to evidence" button in the sidebar to permanently save your selected files for the session. This action is logged.

9. Repeat: You can perform new searches with different keywords until the timer runs out.

10. Download Logs: A log file for your session will be available for download in the sidebar.
